The jQuery `toggle()` function is great for easily switching an element to hidden or not. Today I was [working on something](http://www.olaportuguese.com/interactive/visual-dictionary/face) where I wanted to toggle with a fade out, and I stumbled across the [fadeToggle()](http://www.olaportuguese.com/interactive/visual-dictionary/face) function. Simple and easy to use, typical of jQuery.
