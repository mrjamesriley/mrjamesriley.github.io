One of my favourite aspects to meeting fellow developers is having a rummage through their toolbox - discovering the tools they use, the workflow they follow - unearthing the nuggets of efficiency that would otherwise not come up in conversation. So here I kick off 2016 with a run through of the 5 tools that I have used daily for the past year and recommend to everyone I come across. Along with putting a dollop of butter in your coffee. Try it. So, in no particular order we have...

1. Slack

2. Divvy

3. Evernote

4. Monosnap

5. Telegram
